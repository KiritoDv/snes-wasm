The following is a non-exhaustive list of games that have emulation bugs. Note that there are probably more games that are buggy, but these are the ones that have been verified to not work correctly.

(this list consist mostly from games from the [Mesen-S thread](http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=18658) on the NesDev Forums, the lists of tricky-to-emulate-games from [Sour's Snesdev Wiki](https://snesdev.mesen.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Tricky-to-emulate_games) and the [Snesdev wiki](https://snes.nesdev.org/wiki/Tricky-to-emulate_games), the [Why accuracy matters-article](https://floating.muncher.se/byuu/accuracy/) by Near and additionally some other games that I happened to have tried that have emulation bugs)

## List

- Air Strike Patrol
  - Bugs due to not emulating mid-scanline effects
